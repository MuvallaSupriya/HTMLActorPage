  HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language used to create and structure content for display on the World Wide Web. It is the fundamental building block of all web pages, defining the "skeleton" or structure of a webpage. HTML is not a programming language, but rather a markup language that uses tags to annotate text and tell web browsers how to display content.
